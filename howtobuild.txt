How to build MAME4iOS

Build the libmamearmv7.a library file (if desired - a prebuilt one is already included)

2. Change to the folder where the MAME4iOS makefile resides and type "make"
3. This should build the libmamearmv7.a library file

Compile and install the app bundle
4. Launch Xcode
5. Load the project file xcode/MAME4iOS/MAME4iOS.xcodeproj
6. Make sure Code Signing Identity is set to use your own
7. Make sure product bundle identifier is set properly (I use com.lesbird.mame4ios)

Copy ROMs to the Documents folder using iTunes.
